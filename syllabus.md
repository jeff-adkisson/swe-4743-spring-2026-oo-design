## Course Description 

This senior-level software engineering course focuses on advanced object-oriented design and architecture for modern software systems. Students explore foundational OO principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) and apply design heuristics such as SOLID and cohesion/coupling. The curriculum emphasizes modeling and communication of designs with UML and modern textual tools, critical analysis of design tradeoffs, and the disciplined use of OO patterns (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Adapter, Decorator, Observer, Command, State). Assignments and refactoring exercises reinforce best practices for dependency management, object creation, value objects, and MVC boundaries. The course also covers architectural concerns such as repository patterns and SPA design. A semester project provides hands-on experience synthesizing current design methods and tools in a contemporary IDE.

## Programming Skill Prerequisites
You can use either Java or C# for your projects and assignments. Most of my demonstrations will use C# (I am fastest with that language). This course is a senior level programming class, so you are expected to be already familiar with the following. If not, please review these concepts immediately.

- Public, private, and protected scope
- Classes, methods (instance and static), fields (instance and static), and properties.
- Primitive types versus abstract types
- Conditional logic
- Loops and recursion
- Data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and sorting algorithms.
- Programmatic file management – reading, writing, and updating text files.
- Basic OO concepts such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.
- Displaying and entering data via a console application
- Using an IDE to develop and debug a project with multiple classes.
- Computational complexity (Big O).

## Course Learning Outcomes

1.  Explain the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming including polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and interfaces as they apply to design. 

2.  Interpret and create UML class diagrams using Mermaid syntax to model system structure and relationships. 

3.  Apply the SOLID principles, starting with Single Responsibility and Open/Closed, to improve cohesion and extendibility of designs. 

4.  Evaluate and apply the Liskov Substitution and Interface Segregation principles to ensure substitutability and appropriately scoped interfaces. 

5.  Refactor software to enforce Dependency Inversion and utilize Dependency Injection to improve modularity and testability. 

6.  Compare multiple design alternatives and document architectural decisions to avoid premature commitment. 

7.  Employ object-creation patterns such as Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Builder to manage construction complexity. 

8.  Recognize the limitations and trade-offs of common patterns like Singleton, and use Adapter, Facade, and Proxy to address interface and subsystem challenges. 

9.  Integrate behavioral design patterns including Strategy, Decorator, Observer, Command, and State to address variation and communication in software behavior. 

10. Apply architectural patterns such as MVC and Repository while identifying anti-patterns in SPA and ORM contexts to design clean boundaries in modern web applications.

**The practical work can be in a team of two or you can work alone.** *Teams succeed or fail together.* Each team member *usually* receives the same grade for each such element.

**AI usage must be documented**. University policy on AI permits the professor to decide whether AI usage is allowed. I allow it (though I do not recommend using AI tools instead of learning this profession). If you use an AI, University policy is that you disclose your usage of such tools. See the AI policy on attribution.

## Evaluation and Grading Policies

***Grading Scale***

- A = 90% - 100%

- B = 80% - 89%

- C = 70% - 79%

- D = 60% - 69%

- F = 0% - 59%

***Grade Rounding***

I calculate grades to 2 decimal places. Rounding will occur at the 3^(rd) decimal position. For example:

- 89.984 becomes 89.98

- 89.985 becomes 89.99

- 89.994 becomes 89.99

- 89.995 becomes 90.0

- *TLDR: You need a* **\#*9.995*** *or higher to receive the next highest grade.*

***Late Project Submissions***

Project submissions with 72 hours past the deadline will be accepted. Late work 72 hours past the deadline will not be accepted.

1.  Submit after the due time but within (including) 24 hours - 10% penalty

2.  Submit after the due time but within (including) 48 hours - 25% penalty

3.  Submit after the due time but within (including) 72 hours - 50% penalty

4.  Otherwise, 0.

***Exam Makeups***

Occasionally a student must miss an exam due to illness, death of a family member, etc. You must communicate with me *in advance* to schedule an exam makeup. To receive a makeup exam, you must use the KSU exam proctoring service.

Do not attempt to request a makeup exam by sending me a picture of your car with the hood up, claiming it broke down minutes before the exam. If your car does break down, you must have actual proof from a police officer. Every semester someone performs some version of this. Please do not be that person. On days we have an exam, show up to campus early and be ready to take the exam. This will save both of us a lot of effort and frustration. The exam dates are in the syllabus… plan to be here.

***Midterm Grades***

A midterm grade may be assigned by the midterm grade due date identified on the academic calendar. This midterm grade is for assessing mid-semester performance at least one week prior to the last day to withdraw without academic penalty. You may view your midterm grade in Owl Express. Note that only your final grade will be officially recorded on your academic transcript.

Both exams will be complete by the course midterm. Project work will occur following the midterm.

## Course Policies

**Attendance Policy**

- You are expected to attend each class session. This is an in-person course. The material will not be delivered online, and classes will not be recorded or broadcast. I will only post video lectures in the event of inclement weather, *or* I must cancel a lecture due to travel for my primary occupation.

- You are responsible for knowing about announcements/assignments made in lecture, whether you are present.

- There is no extra credit for attendance though you are far more likely to be successful if you regularly attend.

- I post announcements in D2L and discuss them at the start of each lecture. If you miss a lecture, check D2L or ask your classmates. Please do not email me asking me what you missed.

- The ONLY two days I *require* you to attend are for Exams 1 and 2. Check the syllabus for the dates. If you cannot attend on those days, you must have a written doctor’s note excusing your absence. Exam dates are not negotiable.

**Assignments**

- If you choose to do the (ungraded) assignments and you want them evaluated, post your work to your personal GitHub repository.

  - Each assignment must have a README.md written in well-formed, well-organized, well-written Markdown explaining the assignment, how to execute the code, etc.

- Work will not be submitted via D2L.

**Projects**

- Your semester project will be submitted via your team GitHub repository.

- Your semester project will not be submitted via D2L.

**Textbook Readings**

- The textbook readings, particularly the chapters in *A Philosophy of Software Design*, are essential to receive the full benefit of this course.

- Both exams will cover material discussed in the assigned readings.

## Stuff I Unfortunately Have To Say… 

**Cell Phones, Games, and other Classroom Distractions**

*If you want to waste time, do it elsewhere.* If you are watching videos, scrolling Instagram, playing games, etc., do it elsewhere. I am unlikely to notice, but the people behind you will. And many of them will be distracted. If you are distracting your classmates, I will ask you to leave. If you have a classmate who is distracting you and you are uncomfortable telling them to stop, tell me after class and I will speak to the student.

**Sleeping**

If you sleep in my class, I will throw you out. It annoys me. Do not sleep in my classroom or put your head down on the desk. Just go somewhere else. I do not object to you leaving or not being present. But if you are present, I expect you to be aware and engaged.

**Arriving Late**

If you arrive late, respect your classmates and me by being quiet and getting seated without making a lot of racket. If you routinely arrive late, work on your priorities and stop doing that.

## Instructional Continuity Plan

Kennesaw State University (KSU) may decide to close campuses, operate on a delayed schedule, or transition to remote instruction for inclement weather or in case of emergency.

The University will announce campus closures, delayed schedules, or remote instruction through KSU Alerts sent to your cell number on file and to your university email account. In addition, announcements will be posted on KSU’s home page: .

Our class continuity plan includes:

1.  Communication: Please check D2L for necessary instructions.

2.  Virtual Classes: If in-person classes are not possible, we may transition to virtual classes using recorded lectures.

3.  Assignments and Assessments: Deadlines for assignments and assessments may be adjusted to accommodate the emergency situation.

We understand that emergencies create unique challenges. If you need additional support during an emergency, reach out via email. The university also offers resources such as counseling and academic support, which can be accessed remotely.

## Policy on the Usage of Artificial Intelligence

*AI Use Allowed, but Not Required:*

In this class, you are welcome to use AI for any purpose outside of written (in-person) exams. However, you should note that all AI generative tools still tend to make up incorrect facts and fake citations, code generation models tend to produce inaccurate outputs, and image/art generation tools can produce copied work or offensive products. You will be responsible for any inaccurate, biased, offensive, or otherwise unethical content you submit regardless of whether it originally comes from you or an AI tool. If you use an AI tool, its contribution must be credited in your submission. **The use of an AI tool without acknowledgement is cheating and constitutes a violation of the KSU Code of Academic Integrity.**
